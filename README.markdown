# Can't POP(3) This.

So you downloaded [inaction_mailer](http://github.com/cwninja/inaction_mailer), and you had a folder full of e-mails generated while writing your app?

Now you want to preview your e-mails?!? You people are never happy!

Well, I'm a little tipsy, so I'm going to be nice (you can be nice back, but that's another story), and I'm going to let you get at your mails with POP3!

Wheeeeeeeee!

Also, I stole most of the code from [http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5906](http://snippets.dzone.com/posts/show/5906).

So, erm, yeah.

It will accept any username, and any password, and will only ever serve up the given dir.

I hope you like it. I do!

## Usage
